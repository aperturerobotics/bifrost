# Spacewave Agent Guide

This is the repository-local guide for Spacewave. If a broader workspace
rulebook is already in force, keep following it; this file adds Spacewave's
product model, package boundaries, recurring hazards, and verification commands.
If this is the only guide available, read it with `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
`package.json`, `go.mod`, and the files near the target code before editing.

## Entry Contract

- State the work surface and proof event before editing. For behavior-changing
  work, name the owner, invariant, falsifier, proof command, and adjacent risk.
- Ask before branch changes, commits, pushes, releases, live-service mutation,
  credential handling, destructive cleanup, public API changes, durable data
  breaks, or behavior changes that materially affect lifecycle, concurrency,
  persistence, sync, latency, or user-visible behavior.
- Preserve concurrent work. Treat dirty files you did not edit as user or agent
  work; inspect before depending on them and never revert them unless asked.
- Keep private planning artifacts, phase labels, process notes, and internal
  process references out of Spacewave code, comments, commits, PRs, and public
  docs.
- Prefer the smallest complete owner-level fix, not the smallest diff. Delete
  speculative code and shallow helpers when they sit inside the touched owner.

## Product Model

Spacewave is a local-first Go and TypeScript application framework for
peer-to-peer collaborative apps on Hydra and Bifrost. The shared substrate is
Spaces, SharedObjects, storage/sync, Spacewave Cloud, PluginHost, and Bldr
plugin loading. Focused apps and plugins are front doors over that substrate;
they must not fork account, Space, SharedObject, storage, sync, cloud, or SDK
semantics.

Runtime reach must not fork the product model:

- Go owns SDK/core semantics and native runtime paths.
- Browser Go plugins target `web/js/wasm` through Bldr/TinyGo and run in browser
  workers.
- TypeScript plugins target `js` through WebWorker, QuickJS, and browser QuickJS
  paths.
- GoScript is a selected-package Go-to-TypeScript compiler for browser builds
  and staging gates, not a guarantee that every Go package has GoScript parity.
- Every Bldr plugin has its own bus. Cross-plugin behavior uses explicit
  RPC/resource/plugin-host boundaries; do not assume directives cross buses.
- A frontend `entrypoint=True` JS plugin can still render its root WebView
  across separate `-core`/`-web`/`-app` plugins. Use the existing
  `-core`/`-web`/`-app` layout for app/plugin structure questions.

Spacewave is alpha with real users. Clean breaks are preferred inside the repo,
but never silently break durable local state, cloud state, database migrations,
wire/storage formats, or user-owned data. Surface the reset/migrate/compat
choice first.

## Owner-Level Defaults

- Fix the owner of the invariant, state machine, lifecycle, resource, cache,
  storage, wire format, or UI data flow. Do not add caller-side guards that
  reconstruct owner state.
- A GoScript codegen or typecheck failure is a GoScript compiler bug. Fix it in
  the `github.com/s4wave/goscript` compiler (lowering, runtime override, or
  barrel emission) with a compliance fixture, then bump the `go.mod` pin. Never
  work around it by reshaping the spacewave Go source to dodge the compiler,
  hand-editing generated `.gs.ts`, or swapping to a different API only because
  GoScript mistranslates the first. The spacewave source stays idiomatic Go.
- No fixed-interval polling for state. Owners expose waits, watches, broadcasts,
  conditions, event streams, or context-aware blocking calls.
- No fire-and-forget goroutines from callbacks, handlers, WebSocket frames, or
  hot paths. Use `util/routine`, `util/keyed`, `util/refcount`, and
  `broadcast.Broadcast` under an owning lifecycle context.
- Do not add dead-code fallback paths for impossible conditions. If construction
  guarantees a field, enforce construction and let violations fail at the owner.
- Comments record durable invariants, contracts, boundaries, algorithms, or
  historical failures only. Do not narrate the code, task, or session.
- Docs describe the current system in present-state wording, not migration
  history, phase history, or temporary implementation notes.

## Repository Commands

Run commands from the repository root unless a package README or script requires
a subdirectory.

- Use `bun run ...` for JS/TS/package scripts; do not use `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`,
  `npx`, or bare package binaries from the shell.
- Run `bun install` and `uv sync --frozen --all-groups` before treating
  generated or module-resolution failures as real. The Python sync installs
  `protoc-gen-starpc-python` in `.venv`; Bun does not install Python tools. Use
  `bun run setup` only to repair stale `.bldr` exports or module resolution after
  dependencies are installed.
- `bun install` already runs `go mod vendor` and `bun run setup`. Finish it
  before starting builds, Go checks, or commits in that worktree. Do not run a
  separate `go mod vendor` alongside it: vendoring replaces `vendor/` in place,
  so concurrent writers can leave it incomplete and readers can see missing
  files. Finish active builds and checks before repairing dependencies.
- Keep large command output under `.tmp/` when needed, then inspect a short
  summary or tail. Do not commit `.tmp/`.
- Do not use sleep loops for readiness, locks, files, ports, pids, or results.
  Prefer one blocking command with a real timeout or an event-backed background
  run whose completion is reported once.
- Do not add new prototypes in this repo unless explicitly asked and the target
  runtime cannot be exercised elsewhere. Production tests do not live in
  prototype directories.

## Git, Branches, And Releases

- Do not commit, push, or create/switch branches unless explicitly asked.
- Default branch is `master`. Feature branches use `feat/<name>`; fixes use
  `fix/<name>`.
- If asked to commit, use DCO sign-off and conventional lowercase imperative
  subjects, for example `fix(db): bound opfs root lookup`.
- Never mention private planning artifacts, phase labels, or test-passing
  summaries in commit messages or PRs. Name the product/code change.
- Do not push to `release` unless explicitly asked. When asked to push ordinary
  work, push `master`. Fast-forwarding `release` to `master` is a separate
  explicit release action; no merge commits.
- Before any discard or restore, inspect `git status --short` and the exact path
  diff. Reverse only hunks you authored.

## Dependencies And Vendoring

- Avoid new dependencies for shallow helpers or adapter glue. Prefer stdlib,
  existing repo packages, generated codecs, and owner-local code.
- Before adding an external dependency, check maintenance, license, API shape,
  and why existing code is not the right owner. Ask before continuing if the
  dependency is stale, low-trust, or changes the public surface.
- Temporary local `replace` directives may use absolute paths for local proof,
  but must not be committed. Before landing, publish the replaced repo or use a
  real module version, then remove the local replace.
- After any `go.mod` change, run `go mod tidy && go mod vendor`.
- Never edit `vendor/` or the module cache directly. Patch dependencies in a
  fork or upstream, then update `go.mod` and regenerate vendor.
- The linters and code generators live in `.tools/`, a separate Go module that
  this module does not require. Its `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `deps.go` are copies
  of `go.mod.tools`, `go.sum.tools`, and `deps.go.tools` from
  `github.com/aperturerobotics/common`. `bun install` compares the copies
  against the vendored common module and deletes `.tools/` when they differ;
  `aptre` recreates it from that module on the next lint, format, or generate
  command. Editing `.tools/` by hand is discarded on the next install.
- A `bun run lint:go:*` failure naming a missing `go.sum` entry for a linter or
  one of its dependencies is therefore a defect in that upstream tools module,
  not in this repository. Adding the hash here changes nothing. Fix it in
  `aperturerobotics/common` by running `go mod tidy` in its `tools/` directory
  and then `bash embed.bash`, release, and bump the
  `github.com/aperturerobotics/common` requirement here.
- A dependency refresh that resolves the npm `latest` tag can move a pin
  backwards, because a package may publish its current line under another dist
  tag and leave `latest` on an older one. The downgrade reads as an upgrade in
  the diff. Run the typecheck before landing a refresh, and when a package
  needs a version `latest` does not point at, add it to `resolutions` and
  `overrides` in `package.json` so a later spec rewrite still resolves it.

## Go Rules

- If an outer workspace provides Go/style rules, follow them. Otherwise derive
  the same rules from local code: one owner per invariant, scannable file
  contracts, lifecycle-owned concurrency, and earned abstractions.
- Package/type structure matters more than helper fragmentation. Inline helpers
  that only name local shape checks; extract helpers only for real invariants,
  lifecycle transitions, domain operations, or shared mechanics.
- `cmd/...` packages are adapters for flags, terminal formatting, process setup,
  and calls into domain packages. Durable state transitions, graph or storage
  mutations, runner scheduling, daemon policy, lifecycle recovery, and reusable
  validation belong in owner packages.
- One exported struct per `.go` file when practical, named after the struct.
  File layout: imports, exported type, constructor, getters, `Execute(ctx)` if
  present, other context methods, non-context work, private helpers, compile-time
  assertions.
- Imports have two groups: stdlib then external, one blank line between groups.
- Doc comments start with the identifier and end with a period.
- Prefer getters over cross-struct field chains.
- Use `gopls rename` for symbol renames; do not manual find/replace identifiers.
- Avoid `fmt`, stdlib `log`, package-global loggers, `encoding/json`, `reflect`,
  `sync.Map`, `interface{}` maps, and `panic` for control flow. Use `strconv`,
  `github.com/pkg/errors`, explicit `*logrus.Entry` plumbing, generated codecs,
  typed maps, and explicit owner APIs.
- Log through a plumbed `le *logrus.Entry`; logrus entry methods are nil-safe, so
  do not add defensive nil checks around them.
- Prefer `slices`/`maps` helpers over `sort` unless implementing
  `sort.Interface` or using a legacy API.
- Check new objects for `Release()` or `Close()` and bind cleanup immediately.
- Never discard directive refs with `_`; capture and release refs from
  ControllerBus calls.
- Go filenames use `-`, not `_`, except build tags and `_test.go`.
- Build throwaway binaries through repo scripts or an ignored path. Do not put
  generated binaries in source directories unless a repo script owns that path.

## TypeScript, React, And UI

- Follow `DESIGN.md` for visual language. Styling uses Tailwind v4 theme
  variables in `web/style/app.css`; do not assume utility pixel sizes such as
  `h-4` or `h-16`.
- Avoid CSS gradients unless an existing design pattern requires one.
- Use `cn()` for conditional classes; do not interpolate class strings.
- Import hooks directly (`useMemo`, not `React.useMemo`), prefer
  `useCallback`/`useMemo`, and merge related `useState` values or use a reducer.
- Function declarations for React components. One exported component per file,
  PascalCase filename, co-located tests as `ComponentName.test.tsx`.
- Import paths use `.js` suffixes, even when importing `.ts` or `.tsx` files.
- Import groups: React/external, internal aliases, local/relative, separated by
  blank lines.
- Use `using` declarations for fixed lexical SDK/resources. Cleanup stacks are
  only for dynamic resource sets.
- Raw `useEffect` plus `useState` is not the async data pattern. Use
  `useResource`, `useStreamingResource`, `useMappedResource`,
  `useWatchStateRpc`, `useGetValueRpc`, `useSetValueRpc`, `useRetryWithAbort`,
  `useAbortSignalEffect`, or local app hooks such as `useRootResource` and
  `useStateAtomResource`.
- Raw `useEffect` is only for DOM side effects that load no async data and call
  no RPCs.
- React Doctor suppressions are architecture smells. Split components, move
  async/state into hooks/resources, or use SDK/resource primitives before
  suppressing; suppress narrowly with the owner reason.
- Prefer icon libraries in this order: `react-icons/lu`, `react-icons/ri`,
  `react-icons/pi`, `react-icons/rx`. Keep related components on one icon family
  when possible.
- Use Vite static asset imports for images; do not use
  `new URL(..., import.meta.url).href`.

## Frontend State And Routing

- Components inside the session tree use React contexts, not global URL parsing.
  Use `useSessionIndex`, `usePath`, router context, `useSessionNavigate`, and
  relative navigation.
- Do not reconstruct `/u/${sessionIndex}/...` paths. `SessionIndexContext` and
  `SessionRouteContext` are set by `AppSession`; session indexes are 1-based.
- TypeScript frontend code must not implement crypto, make direct cloud HTTP
  requests, or open raw cloud WebSockets. Add Go RPCs through the Resource SDK
  when the UI needs crypto, HTTP, or WebSocket behavior.
- Persist reload-surviving UI state with `@s4wave/web/state/persist.tsx`.
  Viewer components scope under the provided `['objectViewer', objectKey]`
  namespace with one domain prefix; do not include `objectKey` again and do not
  use an empty namespace.
- `BottomBarLevel` props must be stable. Wrap button renderers in `useCallback`,
  overlay elements in `useMemo`, and pass keys when rendered content should
  update.

## Package Boundaries

- `web/` is the plugin-importable component and SDK surface: UI primitives,
  hooks, SDK wrappers, ObjectViewer framework, and reusable utilities.
- `app/` is Spacewave application code: viewers, pages, session management,
  shell, window chrome, loading screens, and quickstarts.
- Plugins import from `@s4wave/web/`, never `@s4wave/app/`. `app/` may import
  from both.
- When adding plugin-importable files under `web/`, update the nearest `index.ts`
  barrel so `spacewave-web` exposes the API.
- Singleton library APIs must be imported through `web/` re-exports when shared
  across bundles. Example: import `toast` from `@s4wave/web/ui/toaster.js`, not
  directly from `sonner`.
- Object viewers are registered in `app/viewers.tsx` and injected into
  `web/object/` through `ViewerRegistryProvider`.
- Create a separate plugin under `plugin/` when a module has large dependencies
  that would bloat the main bundle. Merge lightweight viewers/services into
  `spacewave-app` with static registrations.

## Bldr Build And Runtime

- Bldr setup output is generated. Do not edit, copy into, or sync files under
  `.bldr/src/`; edit source files in their original locations.
- Controller factories are normally registered through Bldr `configSet` entries
  and package scans, not production `AddFactory` calls. Direct `AddFactory`
  belongs in tests.
- `FetchManifest` idle readbacks are not proof that the manifest can never
  appear, and do not by themselves justify changing build ordering, splitting
  release scripts, or adding fallback paths. Bldr waits on manifest directives;
  first trace the producing manifest builder, selector platform IDs, directive
  refs, and surrounding resolver state before treating an idle readback as a
  terminal missing-manifest failure.
- `bldr/util/gocompiler` owns platform signing hooks. Preserve the env-var
  contract for macOS and Windows signing, and keep signing a no-op when signing
  credentials are unset.
- `bldr/util/logfile` owns file logging. Preserve `--log-file`, `BLDR_LOG_FILE`,
  console-vs-file level separation, auto-default logs for dev and distribution
  entrypoints, and retention pruning.
- Bldr `webPkgs` are shared at runtime through `/b/pkg/...`. With
  `exclude: true`, another plugin must provide the package or runtime URLs will
  404.
- When adding TypeScript that must be bundled for Electron or browser
  entrypoints, update the relevant `//go:embed` `DistSources` in `dist.go`.
- `DistSources` may also grow so a downstream Bldr app can resolve a Spacewave
  TypeScript subpath from `.bldr/src` instead of a sibling checkout. This serves
  the `web/` plugin-importable surface named under Package Boundaries; it does
  not widen that surface. Embed only the subpaths that app imports plus their
  transitive TypeScript imports.
  Downstream apps consume leaf modules, so the transitive set is usually larger
  than the import list and must be walked, not guessed. Never embed a whole
  domain tree or the app surface to save that walk.
- Match the existing entry style and prefer the narrowest form that covers the
  need: an exact file list (`sdk/resource/client.ts sdk/resource/resource.ts`)
  or a single-directory extension glob (`web/fetch/*.ts`). Whole-directory
  entries such as `web/electron` exist for entrypoint trees and are not the
  default for new downstream additions.
- Embed TypeScript and TSX only. Go reaches downstream projects through
  `vendor/`, so domain `.go` never belongs in `DistSources`. The handful of
  embedded `deps.go` and `web.go` entries are `deps_only` build-tag stubs that
  let the dist module resolve packages referenced by `.proto` files; they are
  not precedent for embedding Go logic.
- `//go:embed` patterns cannot contain `..`, so `bldr/dist.go` reaches only
  paths under `bldr/`. A downstream `@s4wave/web/...` import resolves against
  the repository-root `web/` tree, which `bldr/dist.go` cannot embed. Exporting
  that tree needs an embed rooted inside it, not a wider pattern in
  `bldr/dist.go`. Note also that `.bldr/src/web` is `bldr/web`, a different tree
  from `web/`, so mapping a downstream alias at `.bldr/src/web` silently
  resolves the wrong sources.
- `go mod vendor` keeps a directory's full contents once any Go file makes it a
  package, so a TypeScript-only directory under `web/` vendors as empty while a
  sibling with generated Go vendors completely. Do not infer downstream
  TypeScript availability from a populated `vendor/` path.
- Treat Bldr config as the build graph. Change it only when the task truly
  changes build inputs, manifests, platform targets, or generated exports.

## TinyGo, WASM, And Browser APIs

- Treat `syscall/js.Value.Call`, `Invoke`, `New`, `String`, and `js.FuncOf` as
  integration boundaries, not utilities.
- Keep browser API orchestration JS-owned: method dispatch, Promise chaining,
  object construction, typed-array allocation, Web Locks, MessagePort handling,
  and JS exception classification.
- Go should pass primitives or existing JS values and transfer bytes with
  `js.CopyBytesToJS` / `js.CopyBytesToGo`.
- Never block inside a JavaScript-to-Go callback. Copy or retain the needed
  values, start owner-lifecycle Go work, return to JS immediately, and report
  completion through the owning Promise, callback, stream, or port.
- Do not pass raw wasm-memory pointer/length pairs to helper JS for long-lived or
  large data.
- Bound heap pressure before crossing browser APIs; stream or chunk large
  uploads, block shards, SSTables, and RPC packets at the storage/transport
  owner.
- If Chrome reports `RuntimeError: unreachable`, DataView bounds failures, or
  `syscall/js.value*` frames, trace the exact `syscall/js` boundary first.
- Browser/WASM verification needs a real browser path when production crosses
  OPFS, ResourceAttach, Web Locks, MessagePort, blockshard, or runtime streams.

## RPC, Resources, Watches, And Cloud State

- SDK RPCs returning mutable state are server-streaming `Watch*` RPCs, not unary
  `Get*` RPCs. Unary RPCs are for immutable values or one-shot actions.
- The UI uses `useStreamingResource` or watch hooks for server-pushed state. Any
  state changed by CLI, another tab, or a background process must be reactive.
- Proto3 bool fields can deserialize to `undefined` in TypeScript. Use
  `field ?? false` or `!!field`; loading state checks the containing message for
  `null`.
- RPCs returning `resource_id` allocate server resources. Wrap IDs with
  `resourceRef.createRef(id)`, bind fixed lifetimes with `using`, and release
  refs. Never discard resource IDs with `void`.
- Do not add `Unregister*`/`Remove*` RPCs for resource lifecycle that is already
  owned by resource release.
- `useResource(...)` retries on `server-released` resources by default. Disable
  only when server release is expected and terminal; composite returns must
  expose resource IDs through `getResourceIds`.
- Mutable cloud-backed UI state follows:

  ```text
  UI -> SRPC/watch -> Go cache/tracker state -> cloud sync machinery
  ```

- Account state is fetched once when the session mounts, cached in the Go
  provider/ObjectStore, served to UI by Go Watch loops, and invalidated by hash
  changes or Session DO WebSocket notifications. Do not trigger redundant cloud
  HTTP requests from React render paths.
- Multiple React subscribers to the same Watch stream share one Go-side stream.
- Own mutable watches at route/container boundaries and pass snapshots through
  context. Do not start separate leaf-component watches for the same state.
- Do not attach shared mutable/persistent state to per-client Resource wrappers.
  Shared state lives on stable domain owners or registries keyed by stable
  identity; wrappers forward to those owners.

## Cloud HTTP And Wire Formats

- All Spacewave Cloud HTTP traffic from this repository goes through
  `core/provider/spacewave/client.go`.
- Cloud API request and response bodies use proto-binary
  `MarshalVT`/`UnmarshalVT` with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`. Every
  endpoint has typed request/response protos, including empty acks.
- Approved helpers include `doPostBinary`, `doGetBinary`, `doDelete`,
  `doPostStream`, and `doMultiSig`. Do not resurrect JSON helpers.
- Streaming bulk routes, such as packfiles, release artifacts, and R2
  passthrough, carry raw byte streams. Consume them with streaming copies, not
  full buffering into proto decode.
- Forbidden on the Spacewave <-> Cloud boundary: `doPostJSON`, `fastjson`, proto
  JSON methods, hand-rolled JSON bodies, and hand-parsed JSON responses.
- WebSocket frames from Cloud are binary envelope protos with oneof bodies. Parse
  with `UnmarshalVT` and switch on the oneof.
- In Go HTTP clients, drain unread response bodies to `io.Discard` before
  closing unless the full body has already been read or streamed to EOF.

## Data Model And IDs

- SharedObject IDs are lowercase ULIDs. A SharedObject-backed block store ID is
  the SharedObject ULID verbatim.
- Use `SobjectBlockStoreID(soID)` for clarity, but do not prefix or translate
  SharedObject IDs. Cloud `bstoreId` URL params equal `soID`.
- Other ULID-keyed resources also store the ULID verbatim; use separate typed
  columns/wrappers for disambiguation.
- When calling `volume.ExBuildObjectStoreAPI`, pass the mounted volume's
  `vol.GetID()`, never a reconstructed `StorageVolumeID(...)`. Plugin-host proxy
  volumes change IDs; reconstructing raw IDs can hang alias matching.
- When identifiers share a wire shape but mean different domain roles, encode
  the distinction in the owner library API with semantic helpers. Callers choose
  by meaning, not byte shape.
- World object keys are `<stable-type-root>/<self-contained-id>`. The
  identifier is this object's own identity: an opaque ID or a natural external
  identity such as `owner/repo`. Never embed a FOREIGN owner's World object key
  as an identity segment; carry cross-owner relationships as typed fields or
  graph quads, never as key substrings.
- Prefer World Graph edges over storing a foreign object key in a field for
  cross-object references. A key-valued field is the exception and needs a
  stated reason (a consumer that genuinely needs the direct key without a
  graph read); the graph edge is the primary reference.
- Owner-local parent-scoped child keys (`<ownKey>/<role>`,
  `<jobKey>/pass/<n>`) are legitimate for owned children when depth is bounded
  and the segment carries information. Reject constant segments whose nonce can
  never vary; a retry ordinal or role name carries information, a fixed filler
  word does not.
- Every key builder ships its inverse: a parser that splits `(type root,
  self-contained id)` without knowing another object's grammar, counting
  unbounded cross-owner depth, or `TrimPrefix`-recovering an embedded foreign
  key. A prefix scan over one type root enumerates one standalone object
  family.
- Changing a durable key grammar is a data migration, not a refactor: it needs
  an explicit reset, migration, or clean-break decision, and an authorized
  rename uses `RenameObject(descendants=true)` plus rewriting every graph quad
  that stores the renamed key.

## Protobufs And Generated Sources

- Proto imports use Go module paths from `go.mod`, for example
  `github.com/s4wave/spacewave/core/session/session.proto`.
- `sdk/` proto packages use the full `s4wave.` prefix. `core/` protos use
  shorter package names. Cross-package type references use leading-dot fully
  qualified names.
- After changing `.proto`, stage the `.proto` files first if using `aptre`, then
  run `bun run gen`. Use `bun run gen:force` only when a forced rebuild is
  actually needed.
- Never hand-edit generated `*.pb.go`, `*.pb.ts`, `*.pb.gs.ts`, `*.pb.cc`, or
  `*.pb.h`; change the source proto and regenerate.
- Follow existing SDK/resource naming before inventing shapes. Use
  `sdk/world/world.proto` and `sdk/world/` as the reference for resource service
  naming, `MethodRequest`/`MethodResponse`, resource-id access, Go SDK wrappers,
  TS Resource wrappers, and generated exports.
- Block-backed state should be a clean block DAG under the owning World object.
  Make a separate World object only for independent identity, graph
  relationships, permissions, lifecycle, or cross-owner references.
- Block DAG field comments state key encoding and value type.
- Parse stable external payloads into typed proto fields. Raw JSON/wire payloads
  are optional debugging evidence, not the primary model.
- Reuse common proto enums and owner types. Do not duplicate generated enum
  values as handwritten constants.
- Add RPCs to the existing resource service when they operate on that service's
  state or security boundary. New services/packages need independent lifecycle
  or domain identity.
- Never hand-roll protobuf wire parsing or proto JSON; use generated codecs.

## Storage, Concurrency, And Controllers

- A Space holds an unbounded amount of data, and the design target is the
  massive one. Opening a store, a volume, a world, or any index over them must
  not cost time proportional to how much they hold, and keeping one open must
  not cost memory proportional to it either. Derived state that is rebuilt by a
  full scan at open, or held resident in a Go map sized by the stored data, puts
  a ceiling on the Space that has nothing to do with the disk. Read through the
  store's own indexes instead, and make the read cost proportional to the answer
  rather than to the corpus. Writing less data is not a fix; it moves the
  ceiling and leaves the scaling alone.
- Benchmark the shape you are worried about. A cache that pays for itself at a
  hundred entries can be the reason a process takes seven minutes to start at a
  million, and a benchmark that seeds through the fast path and times only
  mutation will never show it. Measure open against a durable store, not just
  steady-state operations against an in-memory one.
- `BeginReadOperation`, `NewTransaction(false)`, bucket cursors, GC wrappers,
  projection hydration, and resource read scopes are lock-owning transaction
  boundaries.
- Never open a second read transaction on the same bbolt/kvtx-backed store while
  holding the first. During mmap growth this can deadlock the process.
- When layering wrappers, wrap the already-scoped store or add an owner API for
  the scoped wrapper; do not call an ordinary `BeginReadOperation` while already
  holding the underlying read scope.
- `broadcast.Broadcast` is the preferred shared-state mutex plus wait channel;
  name the field `bcast`. Read state and obtain the wait channel inside one
  `HoldLock`.
- Preferred util primitives:
  - shared state and waiters: `broadcast.Broadcast`
  - one goroutine per dynamic key: `keyed.Keyed`
  - ref-counted goroutine per key: `keyed.KeyedRefCount`
  - shared background resource: `refcount.RefCount`
  - single retrying goroutine: `routine.RoutineContainer`
  - state-gated goroutine: `routine.StateRoutineContainer`
  - watchable current value: `ccontainer.CContainer` plus broadcast
- The `ctx` passed to a controller `Execute()` is the controller lifecycle
  context. If the only work is wiring lifecycle-gated subsystems, hand them
  `ctx` and return nil; do not block just to keep `Execute()` alive.
- Do not `defer cancel()` or `defer ClearContext()` in an `Execute()` that
  returns after wiring subsystems. Cleanup tied to removal belongs in `Close()`.
- Do not store `context.Context` as a controller field unless it is a documented
  long-lived transport lifecycle context.
- Returning an error from `Execute()` restarts `Execute()` with backoff; it does
  not reconstruct the controller.

## Directive Patterns

- Name resolvers descriptively, store the directive on the resolver, use pointer
  receivers, and return resolver pointers.
- Use `directive.NewValueResolver` for static values,
  `directive.NewFuncResolver` for simple async/watch logic, and custom resolver
  types only for complex state.
- Watch loop shape: `ClearValues`; snapshot via `HoldLock(getWaitCh)`;
  compute/emit outside the lock; `MarkIdle(true)`; select on `waitCh` or
  `ctx.Done()`.
- In `HandleDirective`, do not filter on ephemeral state.
- Never call `AddValue` inside `bcast.HoldLock`; it can deadlock.
- Each directive gets an `Ex{DirectiveName}` helper wrapping `bus.ExecWaitValue`.
  Prefer `Ex` helpers over direct `ExecWaitValue`.
- ControllerBus wait helpers own directive reference lifetimes. Before replacing
  `loader.WaitExecControllerRunning`, `WaitExecControllerRunningTyped`, or an
  `Ex*` helper with raw `bus.ExecWaitValue`, read the helper implementation. If
  it already returns a live `directive.Reference`, keep the helper and bind the
  returned ref to the caller's owner/release path. Inline only when changing
  wait, error, or disposal semantics, and prove that changed behavior directly.

## Testing And Verification

Choose the narrowest tier that proves the changed behavior. Package scripts own
repo-wide tags, timeouts, and e2e gates; raw `go test` is for narrow owner
packages when no script fits.

- Fast repo check: `bun run testcheck`.
- Standard JS/Go/browser suite: `bun run test`.
- TypeScript and lint: `bun run check`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`.
- Repo-wide Go tests: `bun run test:go`.
- Narrow Go owner: `go test ./path/to/pkg` or the matching
  `bun run test:go:<family>` script.
- Browser tests: `*.browser.test.ts` / `*.e2e.test.ts` in vitest browser mode
  for real browser APIs such as OPFS, BroadcastChannel, Web Locks,
  SharedArrayBuffer, and workers.
- Playwright/full app lifecycle: use the relevant package script in
  `package.json` (`test:browser`, `test:go:e2e:*`, or a release lane).
- Release web E2E: `bun run test:release:web` for static release output.

Spacewave is designed to have in-memory implementations for every component and
subsystem. Before writing a mock, look for the existing in-memory owner or
testbed; common anchors include `testbed/`, `db/testbed/`, `db/world/testbed/`,
`db/unixfs/world/testbed/`, `core/resource/testbed/`,
`core/resource/layout/testbed/`, `bldr/testbed/`, `net/testbed/`,
`forge/testbed/`, and `sdk/testbed/`.

Prefer `testbed.Default(ctx)`, package-specific testbeds, and real in-memory
stack components over mocks. Mock only the explicit boundary under test, or an
edge case the in-memory stack cannot reasonably reproduce; name that reason in
the test.

E2E WASM rules:

- Never call `h.Navigate()` in `e2e/wasm`; it reloads the page and destroys the
  WASM process, workers, and WebSockets. Use client-side history routing.
- `e2e/wasm` suites are opt-in with `ENABLE_E2E_WASM=true`. New packages need
  the same `TestMain` gate before booting the harness.
- Use `core/resource/testbed/testbed_e2e_test.go` as the reference for Resource
  SDK end-to-end tests.

After docs-only edits, run at least `git diff --check -- <files>`. After code
edits, run the focused tests plus formatting/lint/typecheck/build commands that
cover the touched owner.

## Public Docs And Links

- Public GitHub docs must link only to public repositories and public docs.
- Do not leak local absolute paths, private planning files, private planning or
  review state, or internal process notes into public docs, code comments,
  commits, or PRs.
- Keep this guide general-purpose. It captures repository rules, recurring
  patterns, and architectural invariants, not task-specific history or temporary
  work notes.

## Documentation Audience

`app/docs/content/` is split into three audience surfaces, and each page belongs
to exactly one. Write for that surface's reader, and check the page against the
test below before committing it.

- `users/` is for someone using the app. They know what a file, a folder, an
  account, and a backup are. They do not know what a shared object, a World,
  UnixFS, an ObjectType, a resource, a provider ID, or a route template is, and
  a user page must never require them to learn one. Say what to click and what
  will happen.
- `self-hosters/` is for someone running Spacewave for themselves or a small
  group. They know disks, backups, servers, and recovery. Name the things they
  operate, in the words the product uses when it shows them those things.
- `developers/` is for someone writing code against Spacewave. Every internal
  noun is fair game here and should be exact.

The test for a `users/` page: every proper noun and every literal string on it
is something the reader either sees in the product or types themselves. A term
that appears only in the source tree fails, no matter how accurate it is. So
`Drive`, `Space`, `getting-started.md`, and a `spacewave` command all pass;
`UnixFS object`, `SharedObject`, `Hydra World`, `the local provider`, and
`/u/{session}/so/{space}` all fail.

Explaining the mechanism is not the mistake. Naming the implementation is. When
a user page has to describe how something behaves, describe the behavior the
reader can observe, and leave the implementation to the developer surface.

The CLI pages are the one place where implementation-shaped strings belong in
`users/`, because the reader is typing them. Commands, flags, paths, and
environment variables are exact there.
