                Beta features may not be as reliable or available as generally
                available services and have not been subjected to the same level
                of testing.

                When the Service exits beta and becomes generally available

                may change; b) these Terms may be updated in accordance with
                Section 18.1; and c) your continued use of the Service after the

                beta-period data, configurations, or customizations will be
                preserved. You are encouraged to export your data before the GA
                Transition date.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The Company may make client-side software applications available
                for download or installation as part of the Service
                (&ldquo;Software&rdquo;). Subject to the terms and conditions of
                these Terms, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
                non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to
                download and install the Software solely to the extent necessary
                to access and use the Service. Software may update
                automatically. This license automatically terminates upon
                expiration or termination of these Terms or closure of your
                account. To the extent a component of the Software contains
                open-source software, the applicable open-source license for
                that component shall govern with respect to that component.

                We may collect diagnostic and usage-related data from the use,
                performance, and operation of the Service (&ldquo;Usage
                Data&rdquo;), including usage patterns, traffic logs, and

                quality-of-service monitoring, billing, and maintaining the
                operation of the Service. We will not disclose Usage Data to any
                third party in a manner that identifies you or any individual
                User, except as required by applicable law.

                2.4 Data Storage and Lifecycle
              </h3>
              <p>
                Your cloud-stored data may be stored across multiple storage
                tiers to optimize cost and performance. Data that has not been
                accessed for an extended period (currently thirty (30) or more
                days) may be migrated to cold storage. Data in cold storage
                remains fully accessible but may experience higher retrieval
                latency compared to frequently accessed data. We will use
                commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any impact on your
                experience, and the migration between storage tiers is
                transparent to your use of the Service. Cold storage migration
                does not affect the durability or availability of your data. The
                specific inactivity threshold for cold storage migration may be
                adjusted at our discretion.

                For email/password authentication, your password is processed

                . As of the effective date of these Terms, the standard paid
                plan baseline allocation is 100 GB of cloud storage, 1,000,000
                write operations, and 10,000,000 read operations per month. We
                reserve the right to adjust baseline allocations at any time,
                effective upon the next renewal term.
              </p>
              <p>
                Usage exceeding your plan&rsquo;s baseline allocation will be
                billed at the overage rates published on the pricing page at the
                time the overage is incurred. Overage charges are billed in
                arrears and added to your next invoice. Exceeding your baseline
                allocation does not result in service suspension or termination;
                overage usage is accommodated and billed accordingly. We will
                provide reasonable tools for you to monitor your usage,
                including notifications when you approach or exceed your
                baseline allocation thresholds.

                If payment fails, we will notify you at the email address

                obligation to pay all outstanding amounts and accrued interest.
                During any period of suspension, your cloud-stored data will be
                preserved for thirty (30) days from the date of suspension. If
                the suspension is not resolved within that period, we may

              <p>
                Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing

                days after the end of the billing period, after which it will be

                You may request immediate cancellation with full account
                deletion. A final billing reconciliation determines whether a
                refund is issued or an outstanding balance remains. To request
                immediate cancellation with account deletion:

                </li>
                <li>
                  Upon verification, a twenty-four (24) hour waiting period
                  begins. During this period, your account becomes read-only and
                  you may undo the deletion request at any time through your
                  account settings. We will notify you by email when the waiting
                  period begins and again before deletion is executed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After the waiting period expires, your account and all
                  cloud-stored data will be permanently and irreversibly
                  deleted. Local data on your devices is not affected.

                  billing period (calculated on a daily basis) is offset against
                  accrued overage charges and the Stripe fixed processing fee
                  described below. If a net credit remains, we issue an
                  immediate refund to the original payment method. If no net
                  credit remains, no refund is issued and you remain responsible
                  for any outstanding balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Stripe processing fee ($0.30 fixed fee per original
                  transaction) is not refundable, as Stripe retains this amount
                  regardless of refund.

              </ol>
              <p>
                Once account deletion is executed, the action is irreversible.
                We cannot recover deleted data.

              </h3>
              <p>
                From time to time we may offer a free trial or other promotional
                billing period in connection with a paid subscription
                (&ldquo;Trial Period&rdquo;). A Trial Period is a temporary
                offer, may be changed or withdrawn at any time, and is limited
                to one Trial Period per Billing Account regardless of the number
                of accounts, email addresses, or payment methods you use. We do
                not guarantee availability of any Trial Period to any specific
                user.
              </p>
              <p>
                To start a Trial Period you must provide a valid payment method.
                Your payment method will not be charged during the Trial Period,
                except for any taxes or fees required by applicable law. When
                the Trial Period ends, your subscription will automatically
                convert to a paid subscription at the then-current pricing for
                the selected plan, and your payment method will be charged for
                the first billing period without further action on your part.
                Auto-renewal thereafter is governed by Section 4.3.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may cancel at any time during the Trial Period through your
                account settings. If you cancel before the Trial Period ends,
                your subscription will not convert to paid and your payment
                method will not be charged for the first billing period. Access
                to paid features ends at the earlier of the end of the Trial
                Period or the effective date of your cancellation, in accordance
                with Section 4.7.
              </p>
              <p>
                Participation in a Trial Period is not a refund trigger. No
                refund, credit, or other compensation is due if you do not
                cancel before the Trial Period ends, if you do not use the
                Service during the Trial Period, or if you are dissatisfied with
                the Service during the Trial Period. Refund eligibility after
                the Trial Period converts to paid is governed by Section 4.7 and
                applicable law. If a charge at the end of the Trial Period
                fails, Section 4.6 (Billing and Late Payment) applies.

                The Service relies on third-party infrastructure providers,

                The Service uses Cloudflare&rsquo;s global edge network for
                request processing, data storage, and real-time communication.
                As a result: a) your requests may be processed at Cloudflare
                edge locations nearest to you, which may be in different
                jurisdictions; b) cached copies of your encrypted data may
                temporarily exist at multiple Cloudflare edge locations; and c)
                the availability and performance of the Service depend in part
                on the availability of Cloudflare&rsquo;s infrastructure. We do
                not currently offer user-selectable data residency regions but
                may do so in the future. All data stored on our infrastructure

              </h3>
              <p>
                Before initiating any arbitration or legal proceeding, the
                parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
                dispute, claim, or disagreement arising out of or relating to
                these Terms or the Service through good-faith negotiation. The
                complaining party shall send written notice to the other party
                describing the dispute in reasonable detail. The parties shall
                have thirty (30) days from the date of such notice to attempt to
                resolve the dispute. Good-faith negotiation is a precondition to
                initiating arbitration under Section 14.2.

              </h3>
              <p>
                If a dispute is not resolved through good-faith negotiation
                under Section 14.1, it shall be finally settled by binding
                arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
                (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time
                the arbitration is initiated. Arbitration will be conducted in
                Wilmington, Delaware, or, at the election of the claimant, by
                telephone or videoconference as permitted by the AAA Rules.

                To the extent permitted by applicable law and the AAA Rules, all

                decision, or award by the arbitrator, shall be strictly
                confidential. Neither party shall disclose the existence,
                content, or results of any arbitration without the prior written
                consent of the other party, except as may be required by
