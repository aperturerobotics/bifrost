                Spacewave is a client-side-first platform. Most data processing
                happens in your browser, not on our servers. All content you
                create, upload, or store using the Service (&ldquo;User

                - is end-to-end encrypted using keys derived from your
                credentials on your device. The Company does not hold decryption
                keys and cannot access the plaintext content of your data. This
                policy explains what data we do handle server-side and why.

              <p>
                Paid-tier cloud data is stored on Cloudflare R2 infrastructure.
                All User Content is end-to-end encrypted on your device before
                transmission; the Company does not hold decryption keys and
                cannot access the plaintext content of your cloud-stored data.
                Data is additionally encrypted in transit (TLS) and Cloudflare
                provides encryption at rest for R2 storage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because User Content is end-to-end encrypted, we are technically
                unable to inspect, read, or review the plaintext content of your
                cloud-stored data. If we have reason to believe that your use of
                the Service violates our Terms of Service (including prohibited
                content restrictions), we may suspend or terminate your access
                to the Service and remove the encrypted data from our
                infrastructure. We may also disclose encrypted data in response
                to valid legal process, though we are unable to decrypt such
                data.

                end-to-end encrypted, and is not stored. The Company cannot
                access the plaintext content of direct device-to-device
                communications in any case.
