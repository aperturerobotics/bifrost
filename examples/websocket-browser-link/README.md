# Quic over WebSocket

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This demo shows how Bifrost communicates between a browser tab and a native
process via **Quic over WebSocket**.

Quic features like stream multiplexing, mTLS, congestion control work correctly.

## Running the server

Start the server with go run:

```sh
cd ./server
go run -v ./
```

The server listens on port 2015 for WebSocket connections.

## Running the client

Run a static web-server to listen on port 8000:

```sh
cd ./browser
./build.bash
python -m http.server
```

Browse to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Open the developer console, network tab, WebSockets list.

Click the "run" button to start the demo.

You will see a WebSocket open with binary messages generated by Quic.
