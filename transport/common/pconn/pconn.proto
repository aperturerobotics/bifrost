  // to t erroneous symbols, or correct up to ⌊t/2⌋ symbols. As an erasure code,
  // it can correct up to t known erasures, or it can detect and correct
  // combinations of errors and erasures. Furthermore, Reed–Solomon codes are
  // suitable as multiple-burst bit-error correcting codes, since a sequence of
  // b + 1 consecutive bit errors can affect at most two symbols of size b. The
  // choice of t is up to the designer of the code, and may be selected within
  // wide limits. Maximum is 256.
